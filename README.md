# Student Depression Analysis Using Machine Learning

A comprehensive **Machine Learning and Data Analysis Project** developed with **Python** to identify and visualize key factors contributing to **Student Depression**.  
It explores **Survey-Based Data** on stress, sleep, social life, and academic workload ‚Äî providing both **Analytical** and **Predictive** insights into students' mental health.

---

## Project Description

The **Student Depression Analysis** project aims to identify patterns and predictors of depression among students using data science and machine learning.  
It examines the relationship between various lifestyle, academic, and emotional factors to help understand how they influence mental well-being.

The project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing** for cleaning, encoding, and normalization  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- **Machine Learning Models** for depression prediction  
- **Visualization Dashboards (Power BI)** for interactive insight presentation  

This study helps educators, researchers, and institutions better understand **risk factors** and take **preventive measures** toward student mental health improvement.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
  Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and normalization.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  Generates distributions, correlation heatmaps, and feature insights.

- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  Trains Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM classifiers to predict depression levels.

- **Visualization & Reporting:**  
  Displays major patterns through graphs, confusion matrices, and feature importance charts.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Visualizes mental health metrics across different student groups.
